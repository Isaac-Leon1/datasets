Gun Runner is a trading game inspired by classic trading games like Dope Wars & Drug Wars. \n \nThe basic rules of trading apply. Buy low, sell high. You must fund your operations by borrowing money. But be careful, the cost of borrowing is very high so you'll need to know the cost of goods to keep ahead of those interest charges\u2026\n\nTo make progress you'll need to aim high. Borrow as much as you can get but only when you know what you\u2019re going to buy and make sure you're getting a good price. The interest rates are non negotiable and the penalties are harsh. \n\nAnd by the way the Interpol is after you. There\u2019s nothing you can do, that\u2019s the cost of doing business.\n\n===========================\n\nBTW - your borrowing power is 200x your cash - debt on the 30 day level""";CUBIC digital;9+;EN;14125056.0;Games;Games, Entertainment, Adventure, Strategy;25/2/2009;28/9/2017

Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can\u2019t be automatically restored, we\u2019ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter \u201eCatanWarp*\u201c (* = 1\u201315) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1\u201315). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We\u2019re avid Catan players ourselves. We\u2019ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****";USM;4+;NL, EN, FR, DE, PT, ES;888494080.0;Games;Games, Board, Strategy, Entertainment;25/10/2009;11/1/2019

An IQ level indicates how one is positioned compared to the majority of individuals in a given age bracket.\n\nThe application ""IQ Test: Calculate your IQ"" includes:\n\n*A free test of 10 questions :\nThis 10-question IQ test is based exclusively on logic. It will allow you to evaluate your capacity for reasoning, determine the range of your overall intelligence, and give you a fast estimation of your IQ level.\n\n*Two 50-question IQ tests : (paid)\nThe tests we offer were carefully prepared to evaluate the intelligence level of individuals. Psychologists supervised them preparation.\nYou will be able to calculate your IQ, compare your performance to the rest of the population and receive a detailed analysis of your intelligence.\nThis report gives a detailed assessment of your strengths and weaknesses in the four identified dimensions (verbal, logical, mathematical and spatial intelligence).\n\n*A 50-question IQ test for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. : (paid)\nThe test we offer had been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. \nIt will allow you to evaluate your intelligence level in four key areas, namely: logic, arithmetic, vocabulary and comprehension.\nThis test was developed especially for children between the ages of 8 and 14 under the supervision of an English-speaking child psychologist. \nIt includes questions that correspond precisely to each age group concerned (8-9 years-old, 10-11 years-old, 12-13 years-old and 14 years-old), and, therefore, in order to obtain an accurate evaluation, it is important to declare the child\'s actual age right at the start of the test. \n\n*The IQ Expert challenge : (paid)\nThis test is intended for high IQ individuals (above 110) \nThe ""expert"" version of the standard IQ test was developed to enable respondents whose IQs are above average (normative IQ score is approximately 104) to take this new and somewhat challenging assessment without answering the same questions usually encountered in IQ tests. \nThis IQ Expert test challenges respondents because it includes questions slightly more difficult than those found in the more traditional IQ tests. \n\nHow to take this test:\n1. You have exactly 35 minutes to answer the 50 questions that follow. A countdown will begin as soon as you start the test and begins again each time the contents of the succeeding page are fully displayed.\n2. You cannot use a calculator, but pen and paper are permitted.\n3. Answer all questions and, if you are not able to, guess the answer. Intuitive responses are taken into account in the general evaluation.\n4. If a question seems to suggest more than a single answer among the given choices, select the one that appears most obvious or more ""reasonable"" to you.\n5. If a youngster of less than 15 years of age wants to take part in an IQ test, we strongly suggest that he/she takes the test for children rather than the regular IQ test. \nIt has been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old.\n\nWhat our users say:\n\nHi, thanx. I really had no problem taking the test. I\'m very satisfied with the results. I\'m really happy that I came off so intelligently! \nI feel truly confident and I had fun with it besides. HELEN - San Diego\n\nThanks for getting back to me so quickly. This is a good site and I hope you\'ll have success with it in the future as well. It sure deserves it! FEDOR - Toronto\n\nIt\'s great to be able to tell others that you\'re one of the 2.3% most intelligent people on earth!

All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We\u2019re avid Catan players ourselves. We\u2019ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program.

The players of the same team sit across from each other at a card table. Bridge consists of two parts: the auction, which determines the contract to fulfil, and the play, where the side that wins the bidding tries to take the tricks necessary to make their contract.\n \nOn Funbridge, you play South while North, East and West are played by the same artificial intelligence (AI) at all tables. So no need to wait until other players are available to play. The AI is available 24/7!\n\nOther players play the same deals as you. The aim is to achieve the best result. You enter rankings allowing you to compare your play to other players.\n\nFunbridge is designed for any type of players: from beginners (introductory module, lessons, exercises) to experts (tournaments). It also suits any player who wants to start playing bridge again (practice, challenges against friends).\n\nGame modes:\n- Get started with bridge: (re)discover the basics of bridge.\n- Series tournaments: perfect to see how you compare with players of your level.\n- Tournaments of the day: compare yourself to players from all around the world.\n- Practice deals: play deals at your own pace without stress.\n- Face the elites: pit yourself against top players from the Elite series.\n- Challenges: challenge any player in head-to-head tournaments.\n- Two-player game: practise with your favourite partner.\n- Team Championship: create your team and compete against teams from all over the world.\n- Federation tournaments: improve your federation ranking thanks to official tournaments held conjointly with bridge federations.\n- Funbridge Points tournaments: play these tournaments to enter the Funbridge Points rankings and compare yourself to all players.\n- Exclusive tournaments: create your own tournaments and discuss the deals you play.\n- Commented tournaments: get valuable advice from a bridge champion.\n\nYou can also:\n- Pause your deal or tournament\n- Watch a replay of other players\' moves\n- Replay deals that you have already played\n- Get the meaning of the bids made at the table\n- Seek advice from the AI in case of doubt\n- Set your bidding and card play conventions\n- Access an analysis of your play once the deal is over\n- Meet your friends and chat with them\n\nInternet connection required: the AI is not in the app, which is therefore much more efficient and we can continuously improve it without you having to update it.\n\nGENERAL TERMS OF USE, PRIVACY POLICY, SUBSCRIPTION, PRICES:\nThe Funbridge app offers a monthly subscription (1 month) and a yearly subscription (1 year).\nIf you subscribe in another currency, the price may vary slightly if your bank charges you a conversion fee.\nPayment for your subscription will be debited from your account after your purchase is confirmed.\nThe subscription is automatically renewed at the end of the subscription period.

When you become the head of the country all the responsibility for the land\'s prosperity rests on your royal shoulders. You will have to fight various enemies and monsters, explore new territories, manage economic and scientific developments and solve a heap of unusual and unexpected tasks. For example, what will you do when all the gold in the kingdom transforms into cookies? Or how will you bring back the trolls who robbed caravans and whose disappearance ruins the economy of the country? \n\nThe core feature of ""Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim"" is that you cannot control your citizens directly. There are a lot of heroes in your lands: valiant warriors and warlike barbarians, powerful wizards and grim necromancers, industrious dwarves and skilful elves plus many more. But all of them live their own lives and decide for themselves what to do at any moment. You are able to issue orders but heroes will follow your commands only for a sizeable reward. \n\n""Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim"" contains elements of role play: while fulfilling your orders, the heroes improve their skills and talents, as well as earn cash to be spent on new equipment, weapons, and magical elixirs. \n\n""Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim"" \u2013 the throne is waiting for its hero! \n\nGame Features: \n\n- Legendary indirect control strategy totally adapted for iOS. \n- 10 types of heroes with dozens of statistics, weapons and armour. \n- A dozen types of monsters. \n- Several dozen spells. \n- 30 upgradeable building types. \n- 15 scenario missions+ a bonus one. \n- 3 difficulty levels. \n- About 100 game achievements. \n______________________________________ \n\n***** ""...Richest real-time strategy game I\u2019ve yet played on a phone or tablet, and also one of the more interesting games of this sort I have played on any system recently."" \u2013 The New York Times \n\n***** ""It\u2019s a great strategy game.

All plays are movie names, and movies are connected by actors. You play a movie connected to mine, then I play one connected to yours. Opponents fire movies back and forth getting points for each play. It may take seven or more connected movies to reach 100 points and win the game.\n\nFireback Movies is simple to understand but challenging and entertaining. Traditional trivia games ask random lists of trivia questions. In Fireback Movies, each player dynamically creates the challenge posed to the opponent on each turn. For example, if your opponent plays Boogie Nights, you could fire back Almost Famous (connected by Philip Seymour Hoffman.) There are limitless possibilities of finding one degree connections between movies using any actor.\n\nFireback Movies is a casual game where players can take their turns when they want. Fireback Movies checks your connections by referencing its proprietary database of 250,000 movies. It knows when there is more than one connection even when you do not. When players take their turns, the app gives immediate feedback to support the option for rapid-fire play. The actors who connect movies are shown after each play.\n\nUnlike most trivia games, Fireback Movies lets you show your personality. In Fireback Movies, players play movies they are familiar with. As opponents reveal their movie knowledge, you learn about them. A game against one friend is a different experience from one against another.\n\nPlays in Fireback Movies are strategic. Some connected movies score more points than others. If you can play a movie with different actor connections from the last play, it is called a Change Connection and gets the most bonus points. Bonus points are also awarded for multiple actor connections and fast play.\n\nWhen players are stumped in Fireback Movies, they can use lifelines or pass. Lifelines are popular movies connected by popular actors that keep the game fun for both players. Fireback Movies is a freemium full-featured game with no limitations requiring purchases or advantages for people to ""pay to win.""\n\nOne Degree Games created Fireback Movies to give movie fans a new way to connect with each other by connecting movies!\n\nFollow us on: \ntwitter - https://twitter.com/firebackmovies\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/firebackmovies\npinterest - https://www.pinterest.com/firebackmovies";One Degree Games;4+;AF, CA, HR, CS, DA, NL, EN, FI, FR, DE, EL, HU, ID, IT, JA, KO, LT, MS, NB, PL, PT, RO, RU, ZH, SK, ES, SV, TH, ZH, TR, UK, VI;45889536.0;Games;Games, Trivia, Strategy;25/7/2014;12/2/2019

Take the work out of running a murder mystery dinner party with easy invites, character question screens, profiles, costume suggestions, and plenty of murder mystery stories in a variety of fun settings.\n\nEveryone gets a character plucked from the story, such as a wild west gunslinger, a down and out jazz pianist, a spoiled rich kid and dozens more. Dress up, get your props together, then show up on the fateful night, in character and ready to play. Whodunnit makes it easy to host and participate in a murder mystery by keeping all the necessary information right at your fingertips. No printing out pieces of paper and shuffling through them at the party, just check your phone for your objectives and acting advice, then try to figure out who the murderer is and why they committed the crime.\n\nThemes\n+ Murder and all that Jazz: 7-21 Characters\n+ Surf, Sand, Sun, Murder: 7-21 Characters\n+ A Rogue in Rumplume: 7-21 Characters\n+ Copper Creek Calamity: 7-21 Characters\n+ Sabotage on Horizon Station: 6 Characters\n\nMore themes and character packs coming soon!\n\nHow to Play - Getting Started\nGather a group of friends (7-21) and decide on a murder mystery and download it to your device. Set a place, date and time for the murder mystery dinner party. You\u2019ll need about two or three hours. Once you finish entering details, you\'ll need to go through each character and share the code with your friends. Prepare for your role! Read the information about your character to understand their motivation and why they might be the murderer. Get your costume together, some suggestions included in the app. Finally, show up at the location everyone agreed to. The host will unlock ""Introduction"" to get the party started.\u200b\n\nHost\nAs the murder mystery host, it\'s your job to introduce the theme to the guests, kick off the investigation and eventually announce who committed the crime. Don\'t worry. We have all of your important lines written out on the app. You just focus on making sure you and your guests have a good time! Whodunnit mysteries are designed for the host to participate in the party, so even though you\'ll be coordinating the whole thing, you still get to take a stab at solving the murder!\n\nLearn more at http://whodunnitapp.com/host\n\nGuest\nAs a guest in a Whodunnit murder mystery, your job is to get into character, follow your objectives, and have a good time!

But this is going to change in Mars Tomorrow. Humans inhabited the once hostile to life planet and took care of turning it into a green and habitable place. By terraforming, Mars is becoming a planet for the new Martians.\nFrom red to green\n\nIn the game Mars Tomorrow your aim is the colonizing the planet in order to transform it into a green planet. The player takes the role of a brave colonist. With the Earth being anything but habitable, the player has to try his luck as a Martian. The settlement project is called Mars Tomorrow and is the beginning of the operation \u2018Life on Mars\u2019 and let you start colonizing Mars with other new Martians.\nThe birth of their own colony\n\nHowever, general living conditions are hardly met on Mars as it is. The red planet seems to be bleak and arid - not even grass grows in the dreary wasteland. At the beginning of your mission you need to gather resources, which are urgently needed for the colonization of Mars. These include water, oxygen and carbon dioxide. Once this is done, all the raw materials are used to produce vital products. The Mars Rovers take care of the transportation to the colony, which will grow over time. As your colony grows, more and more people will decide to settle on Mars. The new residents of the colony help in increasing the colony and a thriving economy will soon be established. Once the economy grows, greenhouse gases are emitted, forming an Earth-like atmosphere. The resulting clouds, rain, rivers, lakes and algae enable the transformation of a formerly red to a green planet.\nProspering economy\n\nAt first glance, Mars Tomorrow appears as a simple building game. However, with increasing population comes a significant increase in the challenges of the economic simulation part of the game. All tasks must be coordinated, so that the economy does not collapse and the survival of the population can be ensured. Once the Mars Rover brought the resources to the colony, terraforming is performed. The larger the population, the more resources are needed. The player is faced with the question: How to master both, economic and environmental difficulties. At first, every Martian only controls a few Mars Rovers, which can be improved by ""plug-ins"". The Mars itself changes every ten days, so the player is faced with many new challenges. Overall, there are eight phases that ultimately give the planet its green appearance and enabling Earth-like conditions on Mars. In each phase, there is also a new type of vehicle.\nTogether for a better life\n\nLife on Mars is not designed by a player alone, but together with several players to experience and enjoy the game together, which makes the game very communicative. Certain resources supply the player Terra points. At the end of a round they will be compared with the points of the other players. The player with the highest Terra point score wins the round. However, not only the winner of a round receives a goodie. The best players of each round will be able to win Tritium, which will be added directly into their account at the beginning of the new round. In the world of Mars Tomorrow Tritium is eventually used to buy settlers accounts, plug-ins and much more.
